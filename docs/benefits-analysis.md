# Benefits Analysis

## Problem

Physical address books have a number of inconveniences: Entries can be difficult to remove, especially if written in pen; if customers want to find a specific contact, they'll need to remember where it is or search through every page; and if a customer loses the book then they no longer have access to all of their important contacts.

The program solves these issues and others by providing an electronically accessible address book where editing and viewing the addresses inside is made easy.

## Benefits

- The electronic address book is accessed from a computer, and as such is not easily lost like a normal address book.
- Editing and removing entries is done with simple commands, and does not suffer issues such as not being able to remove entries written in ink or running out of space on a page.
- Checks are made to prevent addresses with duplicate phone numbers or e-mail addresses being made, where in a conventional address book a customer may mistakenly record a contact more than once without knowing.
- The convenience provided by the program may bring new customers who require an address book.

## Risks

- Customers have to access the application on a computer, so if their computer has any issue they will be unable to access the app.
- Any customer wishing to access their address book away from their computer will be unable to.
- If an error occurs with the program, the database of contacts may be affected, with the possibility of important contacts being deleted unintentionally.
- Customers may be driven away from the company if the inconveniences or errors of the application are too severe.
